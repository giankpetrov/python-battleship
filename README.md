## __Battleship: Guadalcanal 1942__

Welcome to **Battleship: Guadalcanal 1942**. 

Battleship also known as Battleships or Sea Battle, is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids on which each player's fleet of warships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player.

On this project you will be able to play not only the multiplayer version (2 players) but also a History Mode (Player vs Computer) based on historical data with personalised dialogue.
