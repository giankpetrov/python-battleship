## __Battleship: Guadalcanal 1942__

Welcome to **Battleship: Guadalcanal 1942**. 

Battleship also known as Battleships or Sea Battle, is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids on which each player's fleet of warships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player.

On this project you will be able to play not only the multiplayer version (2 players) but also a History Mode (Player vs Computer) based on historical data with personalised dialogue.

### Flowchart

A flowchart is a graphical representation of a process or system that shows the steps or stages involved and the relationships between them. I created a flowchart to provide a visual representation of the steps that a user need to follow in order to achieve a particular goal, such as navigating through the application.
